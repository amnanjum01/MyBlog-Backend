#MyBlog-Backend
The MyBlog backend comprises of the 2 kinds of APIs: author and article. 

The article endpoints deal with all things articles: creating new articles, deleting old articles, editing articles, retrieving articles and so forth. 

On the other hand, author endpoints deal with setting up an account, editing an account, retrieval of author information and most importantly, logging in. 

The apis are thoroughly validated and tested using Postman. Additionally, the login and authentication middleware have been tested and also incorporated in the required apis.
